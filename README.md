# Bounding the standard quantum value of extended nonlocal games : Theory seminar talk
## Version 0.0.1 - 20 September 2016

## Description

A set of companion resources (slides, software, etc.) for my talk on bounds for extended nonlocal games.

## Talk Abstract

## Dependencies

1. [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) (free if UW student check IST Software Portal),
2. [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/) (free MATLAB package),
3. [QETLAB](http://www.qetlab.com/Main_Page) (free MATLAB package).
4. The software on this page. 

In order to run, place the QETLAB folder, CVX folder, and the content from this repository into a folder in your MATLAB working directory. 
Once you add the folder to your working directory, you are ready to run the examples.
